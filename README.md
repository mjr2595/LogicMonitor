## About this Repo

This repo is for helpful scripts, modules, and dashboards for use within the LogicMonitor Platform.
Not all, but most Python scripts will need to run within an environment that has modules in `requirements.txt` installed. You will also want to copy `.env.example` to a new `.env` file and fill in the necessary information. Be sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file!
